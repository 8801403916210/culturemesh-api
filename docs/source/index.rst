The mission of CultureMesh is to connect diasporas around the world by providing
a platform where users can find and connect with people from their place of origin or that
speak their language.

===============
CultureMesh API
===============

The CultureMesh API is the single interface to CultureMesh's database and
services.  You can connect to the API to retrieve networks, posts,
and more.

.. note:: The CultureMesh API is meant to be accessed by CultureMesh-owned services
   like the Android app and the lite webapp.  It is NOT meant to be a publicly-facing
   developer API.

The CultureMesh API started as
a `Stanford Code the Change <https://codethechange.stanford.edu/>`_ project.
